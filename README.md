# Hey there, I'm Gourav R! 👋

Before I dive into telling you more about myself, let me showcase a few projects I'm incredibly proud of building:

🌟 Projects that make me proud
-----------------------------------------
 ### Smart Carry (IoT)
🎒 We wear our backpacks most of the time, but did you know that improper usage of backpacks can lead to severe spinal problems? 😟

Introducing my project to help overcome this issue:

🚀 [Smart Backpack](https://github.com/g-gourav-r/Smart-Carry-Bagpack)

Smart Carry is a revolutionary solution designed to ensure that carrying your backpack is not a burden on your health. With this project, I aim to create awareness and provide practical tips and tools to prevent spinal problems caused by incorrect backpack usage.

### Evade Hunger (PHP)

🍽️ Food is what has kept us alive till now, but it's disheartening to think that in some places, food goes to waste due to excess while others struggle to find a meal. 😔

Introducing my project aimed at bridging this gap:

🌟 [Evade Hunger](https://github.com/g-gourav-r/Evade-Hunger)

Evade Hunger is a compassionate initiative designed to tackle the issue of food wastage and food insecurity. With this web application, I aim to connect surplus food providers with those in need, creating a platform for sharing and caring.

### Meical Insurance Cost Prediction (ML)

💉 Healthcare is a fundamental need, and having the right medical insurance coverage can make a significant difference in one's life. However, accurately predicting how much insurance coverage a person can obtain can be complex. 😷

Introducing my project:

🏥 [Medical Insurance Cost Predictor](https://github.com/g-gourav-r/Insurance-Cost-Predictor)


MedInsure is a cutting-edge application built with machine learning at its core. Its mission is to provide individuals with accurate predictions of their potential medical insurance coverage based on various factors, including lifestyle choices, health metrics, and more.
