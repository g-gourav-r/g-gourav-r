# Hey there, I'm Gourav R! 👋

Before I dive into telling you more about myself, let me showcase a few projects I'm incredibly proud of building:

- 🎒 We wear our backpacks most of the time, but did you know that improper usage of backpacks can lead to severe spinal problems? 😟

Introducing my project to help overcome this issue:

🚀 [Smart Backpack](https://github.com/g-gourav-r/Smart-Carry-Bagpack)

Smart Carry is a revolutionary solution designed to ensure that carrying your backpack is not a burden on your health. With this project, I aim to create awareness and provide practical tips and tools to prevent spinal problems caused by incorrect backpack usage.
